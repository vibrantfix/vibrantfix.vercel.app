 I'm Yogesh aka vibrantfix on the web I'm a final year student pursuing Bachelors's in Computer Science ðŸŽ“ . I'm a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work across technologies. I love to explore new technologies and try to solve real-life problems ðŸš€. Apart from that I also love to listen music ðŸŽµ and play gamesðŸŽ®. 

Self-taught developer and I like to build cool stuff

I'm also into technical writing and blogging (sometimes). I write mostly on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/yogeshx).

I don't talk much over any platform but I like making friends (be it online or irl though I'm somewhat introverted!). So, in case you want to talk about anything, just hit me up and I'll get back to you once I'm active/online. All my social links are listed [here](/links).

That's pretty much everything I know about me yet. In case you know something about me that I still don't, please let me know - I'll add it here.
